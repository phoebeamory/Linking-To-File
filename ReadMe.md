# Linking to a Different File

## Part 1: Creating a New HTML File
1. Click on the + icon next to the files.
2. Add a new file and name it about.html. (You can name it whatever you want as long as it has .html at the end)
3. In the new file, make sure you add the following tags to structure the file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html> </html>
And inside of that:
<head> </head> and <body> </body>

4. In your original file, create an <a> tag. For its href attribute, simply put "about.html"!
5. Test it: does your link work?

## Part 2: You Try
5. In your about.html file, create a link back to the home page.

## Part 3: Linking CSS
6. In your about.html file, notice how it is completely blank. We need to add the <head> section in order to use the same CSS. Look back at the index.html file. What line do you think connects this file to the CSS?
7. Copy and paste the correct lines from the index.html file to the about.html file to link in the stylesheet.
8. Did the background color change to match? If so, it worked!

## Part 4: Practice
12. Follow all the same steps to create a new page called contact.html. This will have your contact information.
13. Link the stylesheet.
14. Link it to your home page and link back.

## Part 5: Bookmarks
